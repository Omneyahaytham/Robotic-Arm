# Robotic-Arm
Simulation of a robotic arm designed on solidworks and simulated on MATLAB and ROS. given a specific points that end effector must follow (Path planning)
used forward and inverse kinematics to minimize the error

Note:
you need robotic toolbox for this project.
need to know how to export solidwork design on matlab.
